# CI/CD Pipeline using Jenkins, Docker, and Tomcat

This project sets up a complete CI/CD (Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment) pipeline for a Java web application. It uses **Jenkins** for automation, **Docker** for containerization, and **Tomcat** for deployment. The application is built using Maven and deployed into a Dockerized Tomcat server.

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- **Java (Maven)**
- **Jenkins**
- **Docker**
- **Docker Compose**
- **Apache Tomcat**
- **MySQL**
- **phpMyAdmin**

## 🚀 CI/CD Workflow Overview

1. **Code is pushed to GitHub**
2. **Jenkins Pipeline Triggered**
   - Clones the latest code
   - Builds using Maven
   - Creates a Docker image
   - Deploys the container to Tomcat
3. **Application runs inside a Dockerized Tomcat server**
4. **Optional**: MySQL and phpMyAdmin services can be added via Docker Compose

## 🛠️ Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Docker & Docker Compose installed
- Jenkins installed (locally or in a container)
- Git, Java, and Maven installed

---

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/CI-CD-using-Docker.git
cd CI-CD-using-Docker

2. Build the Project

mvn clean package

3. Run the Services with Docker Compose
A. Tomcat Only

docker-compose -f docker-compose_tomcat.yml up --build

B. Tomcat + MySQL + phpMyAdmin

docker-compose -f docker-compose_mysql_phpMyAdmin.yml up --build

🌐 Accessing the Application

    Web App: http://localhost:8080/

    phpMyAdmin (optional): http://localhost:8081/
